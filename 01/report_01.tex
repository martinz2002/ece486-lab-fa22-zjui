% LaTeX template for ECE 486 Lab; this template should be used with "report"

% A lot of changes have happened during the last four years. So a major overhaul
% is needed.

% -------------------
% Editor + TeX engine
% -------------------
% There are many online TeX services which require no local installation of TeX
% on your computer. Over the years, I have seen students use
% https://www.overleaf.com https://www.sharelatex.com among others although I
% have no direct experience of any of them. If you do not want any hassle of
% having a copy of TeX on your machine, or you don't mind privacy policies of
% those online services, you can use the online TeX system as well. They will
% serve you well, at least for our lab report.

% If you are really interested in beautiful print, and efficient editing, you
% can explore other options. For example, I use local TeX installations on my
% Linux, Mac and Windows machines. See the original preamble regarding how to
% choose a proper distribution for different platforms.

% As for editors, I use emacs + AUCTeX. You can enable major modes to handle
% *.tex files and minor modes to streamline your typesetting. For example, most
% people will use PDF mode rather than output files in *.ps or *.dvi these
% days; LaTeX-math-mode will speed up entering common math symbols and Greek
% letters; auto-complete will do a similar thing; flyspell mode will give you
% spell check etc.

% As for setting up emacs itself, you can check out Jess Hamrick's github repo
% https://github.com/jhamrick/emacs. I only enabled auctex, auto-complete,
% color-them-solarized, helm, helm-descbinds, and nyan-mode. To get these these
% packages installed, you can use el-get package management for emacs. 

% For ECE 486 however, portable set-up is already available on lab computers
% N:\labs\ECE486\ece486_Emacs_LaTeX
% Configuration files are also available from this repo
% https://github.com/yunlhan/ece486lab_latex/tree/master/emacs_latex

% ------------
% LaTeX how-to 
% ------------
% I use the following
% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX
% https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tips_and_Tricks
% https://tex.stackexchange.com

% ---------------
% Working example
% ---------------
% I wrote a book (127 pages) based on my lectures notes. You can scan the book
% and you may find it helpful when you use LaTeX. For example, how to handle
% cases in equations, how to selectively label questions, advanced graphics,
% references, just name a few. The book is in available in another repo
% https://github.com/yunlhan/ENT40days

% -------------
% Writing guide
% -------------
% You may find the Guardian style guide useful,
% https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a Especially, their
% guide on "quotation marks" and "commas".

% original preamble
%
% This is the alpha version of lab report template in LaTeX. Inspired by the
% effort of Daniel Whisman (enrolled in ECE 486, Fall 2013)
% written by Y\"un L. Han.
% 2014-09-07

% It is recommended to use 
%
% TeXLive on Linux, url: http://tug.org/texlive/
% MacTex on Mac OS X, url: http://tug.org/mactex/
% MikTeX on Windows, url: http://miktex.org/

% For more info about how to use LaTeX (not TeX, TeX is a programming
% language, however LaTeX is not), see a quick guide from ECE Thesis wiki,

% https://wiki.cites.illinois.edu/wiki/display/ECEThesisReview/LaTeX+Resources

% Read the Documentation file ECE LaTeX Guide.pdf down at the bottom 
% of the page. As a starter, you only have to learn briefly how to typeset 
% equations and insert figures and other graphics. As an experienced user,
% however, you can grab the template and write your report immediately.
